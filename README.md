# Loan-Approval-Prediction-System
An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts the likelihood of loan approval based on borrower profiles. This project features a comparative analysis of multiple ML models and a real-time interactive dashboard for predictions.
# 🚀 Project Overview
In the financial sector, accurately predicting loan defaults is critical for risk management. This project explores various classification algorithms to find the most robust model for credit scoring.

## Key Features:
* **Data Preprocessing:** Implemented a robust pipeline using StandardScaler for numerical scaling and OneHotEncoder for categorical variables.
* **Model Comparison:** Evaluated 4 different algorithms to find the optimal balance between accuracy and interpretability.
* **Interactive UI:** Built a Streamlit dashboard that allows users to input borrower details (Income, Credit Score, etc.) and get an instant "Approved" or "Rejected" result with a confidence score.

## Model Performance & Analysis
I compared four different machine learning models to determine which performed best on the loan dataset:
